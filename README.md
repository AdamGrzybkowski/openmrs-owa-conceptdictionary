# Concept Dictionary

This repository contains the Concept Dictionary OpenMRS Open Web App.

> Add a description of what your app does here.

For further documentation about OpenMRS Open Web Apps see [the wiki page](https://wiki.openmrs.org/display/docs/Open+Web+Apps+Module).

## Development

### Production Build

Build the distributable using [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) as follows:

````
gulp
````

This will create a file called `conceptdictionary.zip` file in the `dist` directory, which can be uploaded to the OpenMRS Open Web Apps module.

### Local Deploy

To deploy directly to your local Open Web Apps directory, run:

````
gulp deploy-local
````

This will build and deploy the app to the `C:\Users\Rafal\openmrs\conceptdictionary` directory. To change the deploy directory, edit the `LOCAL_OWA_FOLDER` variable in `gulpfile.js`.

### Extending

Install [Bower](http://bower.io/) packages dependencies as follows:

````
bower install --save <package>
````

Be sure to include the following in your `html` files at the position you want the Bower dependencies injected:

````
<!-- bower:js -->
<!-- endbower -->
````
Do the same for your Bower stylesheet dependencies, but replace `js` with `css`.

Any files that you add manually must be added in the `app` directory.
